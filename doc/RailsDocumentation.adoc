== Post-Mortem

We believe that, overall, the project went well. There were definitely many instances of trial and error. This was crucial in developing an application we believe is intuitive and functional. The biggest challenges we faced were getting the gems to co-exist properly. This project forced us to search for gems, read their documentation, and make a decision on whether or not they fit into our project. The collaboration that took place between team members was something that was of great importance to us. Without it, the project's timely and adequate completion would have been difficult at best. 

===== Areas of Improvement 
Some of the areas we believe we could improve on is our delegation of tasks. We found that some members were better suited for some tasks than others. However, we were able to figure this out fairly quickly and complete deliverables in areas of our strengths. This proved to be highly successful since people were completing deliverables confidently.
